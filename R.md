# R stuff

## Basic commands

`head()`: See the first five rows of a dataframe

`citation()`: Get the citation for R if nothing is included in the parentheses. If a package name is included in parentheses in quotations, you will get the citation for that package.

`merge(x = , y = , by = )`: Merge dataframes x and y by their common column (specified with by =). Using the default setting, only rows common to both x and y will be retained in the merged dataframe.
