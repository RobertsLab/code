# readme
 In this directory code snippets are organized in separate markdown files based on software, task, etc.
 
 The [Wiki for this repo](https://github.com/RobertsLab/code/wiki) contains more detailed guides and instructions on things like:
 
 - [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/RobertsLab/code/wiki/Jupyter-Notebook-Guide).
     - Jupyter Notebooks are an ideal means to document (and improve reproducibility) of computing commands.
 - [Super Computing with Mox (hyak)](https://github.com/RobertsLab/hyak_mox/wiki)
     - Mox is a high powered designed computer designed for seriously intensive computing
     - Due to the steep learning curve, it has its own dedicated wiki.
 - [Docker](https://github.com/RobertsLab/code/wiki/Docker-Guide)
     - Docker is a means to run a virtual Linux computer (great for Windows users!).
     - We have as Docker setup to install the most commonly used software used in the Roberts Lab, including Jupyter Notebook.
