### Apptainer (Singularity) Definition Files

This is a repository for all of [the Roberts Lab](https://robertslab.github.io/resources/) definition files used for creating [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) images.

---

- [`r_packages_installs.R`](./r_packages_installs.R): R package installation instructions required for building the Roberts Lab bioinformatics container with [`srlab-bioinformatics-container.def`](./srlab-bioinformatics-container.def).

- [`srlab-bioinformatics-build.sh`](./srlab-bioinformatics-container.def): A Bash script used to build the Apptainer container generated by [`srlab-bioinformatics-container.def`](./srlab-bioinformatics-container.def). The script is specifically designed to be executed on the UW Hyak HPC, Klone. It will:

  1. Execute the most recent commit of [`srlab-bioinformatics-container.def`](./srlab-bioinformatics-container.def).

  2. Copy [`r_packages_installs.R`](./r_packages_installs.R) to `/tmp/` (needed for build process).

  3. Move completed Apptainer container to `/gscratch/srlab/containers/srlab-bioinformatics-container-<commit>.sif`.

- [`srlab-bioinformatics-container.def`](./srlab-bioinformatics-container.def): Apptainer definition file for the Roberts Lab bioinformatics container. Built on the `rocker/rstudio:4.4.1` image to allow usage of RStudio.
