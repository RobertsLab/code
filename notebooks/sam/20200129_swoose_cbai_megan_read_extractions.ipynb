This is performed because MEGAN6 strips paired read ID after the first space. As such, the resulting read extractions using MEGAN end up with a FastA file containing two reads with identicial headers. Not sure if this will cause any downstream issues (i.e. with Trinity) where paired end data is used, so playing it safe and using the truncated IDs to pull FastQs with complete sequence headers for use in subsequent data wrangling."
