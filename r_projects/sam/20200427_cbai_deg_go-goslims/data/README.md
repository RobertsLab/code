FILES

- `goslim_generic.obo`: Gene Ontology GOslim file downloaded from [http://geneontology.org/docs/go-subset-guide/](http://geneontology.org/docs/go-subset-guide/)


- `*.flattened`: Up-regulated DEGs which yielded enriched GO terms. Files have been "flattened", so that each GO term is on a single line.
