### Update _P.[_Panopea generosa_ (Pacific geoduck)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoduck) genome annotation file

An R Project to update the original annotation file [initiated by this GitHub Issue](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1602), with the goal to update the file by adding columns grouping GO IDs by Biological Process (BP), Cellular Component (CC), and Molecular Function (MF). Also add a column grouping BP GOslims and corresponding BP GOslim terms for each gene.
