### Load necessary libraries

```{r libraries, message = FALSE}
library(GSEABase)
library(tidyverse)
```


### Download Generic GOslim from Gene Ontology Consortium to proper GSEAbase directory

```{r Download_GOslim_file}

# Find install location for GSEAbase
gseabase_location <- find.package("GSEABase")

# Set GOslim URL
goslims_url <- "http://current.geneontology.org/ontology/subsets/goslim_generic.obo"

# Set file name of target GO slim file
goslims <- "goslim_generic.obo"

# Set the download file location for the GOslim file
# Needs to be in the "extdata" directory where GSEAbase is installed
outfile_dest <- file.path(gseabase_location, "extdata", goslims, fsep = "/")

# Download the generic GOslim file in the GSEAbase "extdata" directory
download.file(url = goslims_url,
              destfile = outfile_dest)
```
